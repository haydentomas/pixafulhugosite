title: Static site development with Netlify, Hugo and Forestry

---
As a developer, I enjoy working with a hide variety of languages, content management systems and environments.

The one thing that i have not managed to do successfully is develop a fully featured static website. I tried Gatsby briefly but as I lack in the JavaScript department it can feel a bit like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut.

So I have decided to give Hugo a try!

Recently I began to mess around with the recreation of my portfolio website, I wasn't happy with the dismal results I was getting from using Wordpress. It has it's uses but it can quite a beast to tame.

For most of my clients I will continue to use it as they have budgets that are smaller than time for hand coding will allow. I tend to use Elementor or Beaver Builder for fast development turnarounds.

That being said, If I can create a good boilerplate that allows me to knock out Hugo sites quickly then in some cases I might be tempted to continue using Hugo. Also with netlify offering a pretty decent free hosting plan, what's not to love!
